# Apillon Bug Bounty and Usability Report Template

Apillon.io invites developers to participate in our Bug Bounty program hosted on GitHub, where you can help us improve our services by reporting bugs and usability feedback while being rewarded for your efforts.

## Bug Bounty Process
1. **Register and start:** Sign up for the Apillon platform on https://app.apillon.io
2. **Create a new project**
3. **Visit your profile and connect the EVM compatible wallet, where you will receive the reward**
4. **Find your project UUID and copy it** - you will need to include the UUID in the bug bounty report, so we can match your report with your project. You can find the UUID in the "Settings" section of your project.
5. **Provide feedback:** Dive into the features, share your thoughts, write the report, include screenshots and submit it here on GitHub.
6. **Collect your bounty:** NCTR rewards for effort and dedication — straight to your wallet.

*By submitting the project UUID you agree Apillon can reach out to your supplied email and or process transactions to your target wallet*
